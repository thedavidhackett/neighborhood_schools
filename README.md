# Saint Louis Neighborhood Schools

## About the project

This was my final project for Python Programming (through the MSCAPP program at the University of Chicago). It built off my previous work with neighborhood and charter schools in Saint Louis. I used pandas and jupyter notebooks to further clean and format the data for the project and then utilized NumPy to run regressions and Matplotlib to do visualizations. The project was meant to look at and model the declining number of neighborhood schools as well as investigate the impact charter schools have had on that decline.

## Running the project locally

You should have jupyter notebook installed

Run jupyter notebook in the project directory

When the explorer pops up (you might need to navigate to http://localhost:8888/tree) you can click on time_series.ipynb or prediction_data.ipynb to see the data analysis and visualizations.
